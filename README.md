# Hello Mynx (Pre-Alpha)
This repository serves as a starting place for using the Mynx programming language. I'll try to regularly push updates to it and the included .vse(vscode extension).

## "Big" Problems
- ! - A lot of mising intelisense.
- ! - No logical operators. (or, and, not)
- ! - No comparison operators. (<, <=, ==, >=, >)
- ! - No iterables. (Map, List)
- ! - No loops.
- ! - No map-to. (map val in list to result: 0 (...))
- ! - Functions cannot be called without being assigned to a variable.
- ! - And many more that I will add as I find them.

## Setup
1. Ensure [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) are installed on your computer.
1. Fork this repository.
2. Install the included vscode extension.

    2. $ `npm i`
    2. $ `vite`
