# Hello Mynx (Pre-Alpha)
Mynx is in a very pre-alpha state, but if you would like to try it out this is the place to be. I'll shoot to almost daily update the vscode extension installer in this repository.

## "Big" Problems
- ! - A lot of mising intelisense.
- ! - Auto-format is broken.
- ! - No iterables. (Map, List)
- ! - No loops.
- ! - No map-to. (map val in list to result: 0 (...))
- ! - Functions cannot be called without being assigned to a variable.
- ! - And many more that I will add as I find them.

## Setup
1. Ensure [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) are installed on your computer.
1. Fork this repository.
2. Install the included vscode extension.
    1. $ `code --install-extension ./Mynx-0.0.1.vsix`
3. Open the folder in vscode.
3. Run the app.
    1. $ `cd ./builds/website`
    2. $ `npm i`
    2. $ `vite`
    3. Open the url in a browser.
4. Read [learn-mynx.md](https://github.com/monode-dev/hello-mynx/blob/main/learn-mynx.md).
3. Start coding, the Mynx extension will automatically compile any .mx files whether you want it to or not.
